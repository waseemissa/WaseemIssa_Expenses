************************ Expenses Tracker Website ************************

On behalf of SE Factory's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, we were asked
to integrate an interactive frontend with a backend that returns json data instead of 
only html data. A portion of the application might be created using a regular html/php 
request/response cycle (for login/register).  
For the expenses portion of the application, we must use asynchronous 
calls. 
 
Requirements 
Create a browser application that allows users to register and login 
to do the following: 
• Add/Edit expenses (also delete)  
o With a date 
o Amount 
o Category of expense  
• List all expenses 
• Create a side view that uses an external JS library (our 
choice) to show the expenses in a pie chart, grouped by 
categories. 
 
 
The application will have a backend that the web page can interact with 
through asynchronous calls. This API will be json based, and it should 
securely separate the user data from each other, without a possibility 
of leakage between them.
